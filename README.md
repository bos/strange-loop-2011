# Slides from the Haskell workshop at Strange Loop 2011

I gave a 3-hour "intro to Haskell" workshop at the Strange Loop
conference, on September 18, 2011. These are the slides I used,
with a couple of post-workshop bugs fixed.

You can [read the slides online
here](http://bos.github.com/strange-loop-2011/slides/slides.html).

They're formatted from Markdown to HTML using John MacFarlane's
fabulous [pandoc tool](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

Feel free to use them yourself, but if you do, please give attribution
to me. Thanks!
